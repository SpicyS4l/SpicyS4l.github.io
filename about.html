      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm someone whoâ€™s passionate about cybersecurity and enjoys solving complex problems using data and queries. 
        With over 8 years of experience in the field, I've built and collected a variety of queries designed to help identify threats, vulnerabilities, and other insights across different environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is my way of giving back to the cybersecurity community by sharing some of the queries I've created or come across during my journey. 
        These queries are intended to help others in their hunt for threats, analysis of incidents, and overall enhancement of security posture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a beginner learning the ropes or a seasoned professional looking for specific insights, I hope these queries prove useful to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something here that makes your work a little easier!
